## We get by with a little help from our friends.

We are a self sustaining theatre collective, and we require certain funds to make our art grow. We want to reach out to as many people and bring out under-represented stories to the forefront for which we need your help to uncompromised work. Friends with deep pockets, and generous hearts, please contribute to us by becoming #friendsofkathaghera. We are currently designing perks for the same.

Contact us to help support our work.
