### A 130 seater black box theater open for rentals, collaborations and artistic junctions.

Kausi emerged from a need for a space to practice work that we identified with and are passionate about. What initially began as an idea for at least a workshop space or a playback performance venue, evolved into an intimate 'black box theater', from what was initially a barren roof top space. While it will primarily be Katha Gheraâ€™s work space, we also want to offer the space to any genuine artists, makers or performers as an inclusive platform for socio-politically relevant work. This can happen through renting the space, as well as collaborations.
